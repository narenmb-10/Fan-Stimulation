# Fan Simulator

A simple web-based fan simulator with sound effects for turning on, turning off, and different speed settings. This project uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an interactive fan simulation with audio feedback.

## Features

- **Fan Animation**: The fan image rotates to simulate the fan running.
- **Sound Effects**: Different sound effects for turning the fan on, off, and changing speeds.
- **Speed Control**: Three-speed settings for the fan.

### Usage

- **ON Button**: Turns on the fan with an initial speed of 1.
- **OFF Button**: Gradually slows down and stops the fan.
- **Speed Buttons (1, 2, 3)**: Changes the fan speed to 1, 2, or 3 respectively.

## Code Overview

### HTML

The HTML file contains the page's structure, including buttons for controlling the fan and audio elements for the sound effects.

### CSS

The CSS file includes styles for the layout and animation of the fan.

### JavaScript

The JavaScript code handles the fan's functionality, including the rotation speed and the playback of audio clips.

### Audio Files

- `on.mp3`: Sound effect for turning the fan on.
- `off.mp3`: Sound effect for turning the fan off.
- `speed1.mp3`: Sound effect for fan speed 1.
- `speed2.mp3`: Sound effect for fan speed 2.
